## 🏗️ System Architecture

StudyHub follows a client-server architecture, consisting of the following components:

### Front-end
The platform's frontend is built using React.js, providing a dynamic and responsive user interface. It communicates with the back end via RESTful APIs to handle user actions such as course browsing and enrollment.

### Back-end
Built with Node.js and Express.js, the back end serves APIs for functionalities such as user authentication, course management, and content delivery. The server logic handles the processing and storing of course data and user information.

### Database
MongoDB stores unstructured and semi-structured data, including course content (videos, PDFs, images) and user data. Its flexibility allows for easy scalability and efficient management of dynamic content.
